Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles

From here, you can enter a new name for the role, and select the permissions you want for that agent.

This agent can have all these permissions assigned to them, which would give these abilities on OsTicket

Configure Departments

Departments are basically the different divisions of the company that handle different tasks.

Admin Panel -> Agents -> Departments

 ![image](https://github.com/cblack5880/post-install-config/assets/138612466/c1b66902-83ce-4f2e-bf7f-388602ad6f25)

One could create a department name. There will be areas where one could also set up an SLA for that department's response to tasks.

Once you are done editing your settings, click Create Dept.

Configure Teams

Configure teams could help with delegating tasks to different agents. (Even if they are in different departments.  Having agents from different departments will supersede the department rules.

At this moment, You are only naming the team. Once this is done, you can select its members.

Configure Agents

Configuring agents would allow you to give access to different agents. When adding an agent, they will need to be assigned to a primary department and given a primary role for the tickets.

Admin Panel -> Agents -> Add New

![image](https://github.com/cblack5880/post-install-config/assets/138612466/d23f2e60-a9a5-4faf-9727-c874b1331cdb)

From here, you would just fill out the name and email address field. And also set a default Password for the agents.
